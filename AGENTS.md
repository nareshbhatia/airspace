# Project Instructions

This project is the ground control station for
[Flightpath](https://github.com/flightpath-dev/flightpath). It uses gRPC to send
MAVLink commands to the Flightpath server and receive MAVLink messages from the
server.

## Reference Documentation

- [MAVLink Protocol Specification](https://mavlink.io/en/): Used to control the
  drone.
- [MAVLINK Common Message Set](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html): Part
  of the above specification that contains a set of common messages and commands
  that should be implemented by MAVLink-compatible systems.
- [MAVLINK Common Message Set in XML format](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml):
  The common message set in a structured XML format. This is easier for
  programmatic understanding. Note that this set includes
  [standard.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/standard.xml),
  which itself includes
  [minimal.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/minimal.xml).
  For a full understanding of the protocol, it's important to understand all
  three.
- [PX4 implementation of MAVLink Specs](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/mavlink/standard_modes):
  This page from the PX4 Guide describes how PX4 implements the MAVLink
  protocol. Specifically look at
  [Other MAVLink Mode-changing Commands](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/mavlink/standard_modes#other-mavlink-mode-changing-commands)
  for a list of specific commands to change modes. These can be more convenient
  that just starting the mode, in particular when the message allows additional
  settings to be configured.
- [gomavlib](https://github.com/bluenviron/gomavlib): The Go library used by the
  Flightpath server to send MAVLink commands to the drone and receive MAVLink
  messages. Use these docs to understand the server capabilities. Especially,
  look at the
  [examples](https://github.com/bluenviron/gomavlib/tree/main/examples)
  directory to understand MAVLink workflows to achieve specific goals.

## Project documentation

Internal guides live under `docs/`. Before changing map, Three.js, coordinate,
or Zustand store code, read the matching doc below.

### Mapbox

When working with Mapbox GL JS, map layers, GeoJSON sources, or
[`src/lib/mapbox`](src/lib/mapbox), read [Mapbox 101](docs/mapbox-101.md)
(`docs/mapbox-101.md`) first.

Summary (full mental model and examples in that doc):

- Think in **style**, **sources**, and **layers**; coordinates are
  **`[lng, lat]`** (longitude first).
- Mapbox is a 3D renderer; a familiar “2D” map is usually **orthographic
  projection + pitch 0**.
- Live data loop: **add source → add layer → `setData`** on the source.

### Three.js

When working with Three.js scenes, cameras, meshes, or
[`src/lib/threejs`](src/lib/threejs), read [Three.js 101](docs/threejs-101.md)
(`docs/threejs-101.md`) first.

Summary:

- **Scene**, **camera**, and **renderer**; draw with
  `renderer.render(scene, camera)`.
- Default axes: **y up**, **z toward the viewer**; `PerspectiveCamera` looks
  along **negative z**.
- Use **`Group`** for hierarchies; choose **near/far** carefully (matters when
  combining with maps).

### Three.js in Mapbox

When embedding Three.js in a **Mapbox custom layer** or debugging camera
alignment, read [Using Three.js in Mapbox](docs/using-threejs-in-mapbox.md)
(`docs/using-threejs-in-mapbox.md`) first.

Summary:

- **One WebGL context** on the map canvas; Mapbox and Three.js must not fight
  over GL state.
- **Camera/projection must match** the map or content slides, clips, or z-fights
  with terrain; Threebox **`CameraSync`** rebuilds projection from
  `map.transform` with explicit **near/far**.
- Call **`map.triggerRepaint()`** when the Three.js scene keeps updating outside
  map camera moves.

### Geospatial coordinates (WGS84 vs Web Mercator)

When converting **lng/lat** to map or Three.js space, using
`src/lib/mapbox/utils/mercatorUtils.ts`, or working on custom-layer route
rendering, read
[WGS84 vs Web Mercator](docs/wgs84-vs-web-mercator-coordinate-system.md)
(`docs/wgs84-vs-web-mercator-coordinate-system.md`) first.

Summary:

- **WGS84** (`lng`, `lat`, altitude) is geographic input; **Web Mercator** is
  Mapbox’s render/projection space (`MercatorCoordinate`, tiles).
- Custom layers need a **georeference origin** (map center + terrain elevation)
  so local Three.js coordinates stay numerically stable and vertically aligned.
- Pipeline in this repo: WGS84 → Mercator → **local offsets** → Three geometry →
  **`mapMatrix * modelTransform`** in the custom layer `render` pass.

### State management (Zustand)

When adding or changing Zustand stores—especially a feature `store/` directory
with multiple slices—read [Zustand conventions](docs/zustand-conventions.md)
(`docs/zustand-conventions.md`) first and follow it.

Summary (full layout, naming, and merge order in that doc):

- Use the `store/` layout (`types/`, `slices/`, `selectors/`,
  `create<Feature>Store.ts`) when one feature needs several slices in a single
  `StoreApi` instance.
- Keep `store/types/` declarative; put slice logic in `store/slices/` and
  derived read logic in `store/selectors/` (no React in `store/`).
- Merge slices in a documented order when later slices call `get()` on earlier
  state; export a **factory** (`create<Feature>Store`), not a global singleton,
  when tests need isolated instances.

## Coding Style

- **Use TypeScript** for all new files.
- **Prefer `undefined` over `null` to represent the absence of a value.** Use
  `undefined` consistently for unset, missing, or cleared state. Avoid mixing
  `null` and `undefined` for the same semantic purpose.
  - Exception – context: Use `null` as the argument to createContext() when
    there is no meaningful default. Reason: React docs recommend `null` for this
    case.
  - Exception – refs: Use null for ref initial values and when clearing
    ref.current (e.g. useRef<T>(null), ref.current = null). Reason: React uses
    null for DOM refs and the same convention for all refs keeps the rule
    simple.
- **Do not use barreling.** Barreling is the practice of re-exporting multiple
  modules from a single entry file (commonly `index.ts` or `index.js`) so that
  consumers can import from a folder path instead of from individual files (e.g.
  `import { Foo, Bar } from '../components'` instead of
  `import { Foo } from '../components/Foo'` and
  `import { Bar } from '../components/Bar'`). Avoid it in this project because:
  - **Tree-shaking and bundle size:** Bundlers often pull in the whole barrel
    when any symbol is used, so one import can pull in unrelated code and weaken
    dead-code elimination.
  - **Refactors and rename safety:** Moving or renaming a file forces updates to
    the barrel and every re-export; direct file paths make the dependency
    explicit and easier to update (e.g. with find-and-replace).
  - **Discoverability and clarity:** Importing from the file that defines the
    symbol (e.g. `from '../DroneServiceProvider/DroneServiceProvider'`) makes
    the source of truth obvious; barrels hide where symbols actually live.
  - **Circular dependencies:** Barrels can introduce or obscure circular
    imports, which cause subtle runtime and build failures. Prefer importing
    directly from the defining file:
    `from '../DroneServiceProvider/DroneServiceProvider'` rather than
    `from '../DroneServiceProvider'` or `from '../providers'`.
  - **Exception – library packages:** You may use a barrel `index.ts` under
    [`src/lib/mapbox`](src/lib/mapbox) and [`src/lib/threejs`](src/lib/threejs)
    so consumers can import stable public APIs from the package root (e.g.
    `from '../../lib/threejs'`). Keep barrels limited to these folders;
    elsewhere the no-barrel rule still applies.

### Coding Style for imports

Don't mix type imports with regular imports, separate them out.

Example:

```ts
// DON'T DO THIS
import {
  StatusIndicator,
  type StatusIndicatorColor,
} from '../StatusIndicator/StatusIndicator';

// DO THIS INSTEAD
import { StatusIndicator } from '../StatusIndicator/StatusIndicator';

import type { StatusIndicatorColor } from '../StatusIndicator/StatusIndicator';
```

### Coding Style for Enumerations

When creating enumerations in TypeScript, follow these rules:

1. **Enum naming**: Use the `Enum` suffix for the enum name (e.g., `IntentEnum`,
   `StatusEnum`)
2. **Enum keys**: Use PascalCase string literals as enum keys
3. **Enum values**: Use camelCase string literals as enum values
4. **Type alias**: Create a type alias using template literal types to extract
   the enum values
5. **Export both**: Export both the enum and the type alias
6. **Prefer type alias**: Prefer the use of type alias over the enum. The enum
   should primarily used for iteration only.

This pattern allows you to:

- Use the enum for type-safe comparisons: `if (value === IntentEnum.Neutral)`
- Use the type alias for function parameters and return types:
  `function getIntent(): Intent`
- Get autocomplete and type checking for all enum values

Example:

```ts
export enum SeverityEnum {
  Info = 'info',
  Success = 'success',
  Warning = 'warning',
  Error = 'error',
}

export type Severity = `${SeverityEnum}`;
```

### Coding Style for React Components

- **Use named functions** for components. Define the component as a named
  function (e.g. `function FlightCommandPanel(...)`) rather than a default
  export or anonymous function.
- **Define props in an interface** above the component, named
  `ComponentNameProps`.
- **Event handlers passed as props** should be named `onEventName`, e.g.
  `onTakeoff`.
- **Event handlers inside components** should be named `handleEventName`, e.g.
  `handleTakeoff`. They should be wrapped in `useCallback` when passing to child
  components to provide a stable reference.
- **Style with Tailwind**. Use the **semantic design tokens** from
  `packages/autopilot/src/styles/globals.css` (e.g. `bg-card`, `bg-background`,
  `text-foreground`) instead of raw Tailwind color utilities so theming and dark
  mode stay consistent.
- **Merge class names with the `cn` utility** (`utils/cn`). Pass base classes
  first and `className` last so callers can override:
  `cn('base classes', className)`.
- **Prefer Shadcn components** over raw HTML (e.g. use Shadcn `<Button>` instead
  of `<button>`, `<Separator>` instead of a custom divider).
- **Follow best practices and idiomatic constructs when writing custom
  components**: For example, many apps using the Shadcn library construct lists
  using `<ul>` and `<Card>`.

Example:

```tsx
interface FlightCommandPanelProps {
  className?: string;
  onTakeoff: (altitudeFt: number) => void;
}

/**
 * FlightCommandPanel component for controlling drone flight operations.
 */
export function FlightCommandPanel({
  className,
  onTakeoff,
}: FlightCommandPanelProps) {
  return (
    <div className={cn('flex flex-col bg-card rounded-lg py-2', className)}>
      <Button onClick={onTakeoff}>Takeoff</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Repository Management

We use one of two approaches to manage repositories:

1. For simple projects, we use a **polyrepo** strategy where each project or
   service is assigned its own independent repository.
2. For complex projects, we use a **monorepo** strategy where all projects,
   libraries and services are consolidated into a single repository.

If a repository contains a `turbo.json` file at the root level, it is a monorepo
otherwise it is a polyrepo. That's because we use
[Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev/) to manage our monorepos and `turbo.json` is
the configuration file for turborepo.

## Dependencies Management

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager. Commands to add a new
dependency to a repository depend on whether it is a polyrepo or a monorepo.

### Adding a dependency to a polyrepo

```shell
# add a regular dependency
pnpm add <pkg>

# add a dev dependency
pnpm add -D <pkg>

# Example
pnpm add date-fns
```

### Adding a dependency to a monorepo

When installing a dependency in a monorepo, it should be installed directly in
the package that uses it. The package's package.json will have every dependency
that the package needs.

```shell
# add a regular dependency
pnpm add <pkg> --filter <pkg_selector>

# add a dev dependency
pnpm add -D <pkg> --filter <pkg_selector>

# Example
pnpm add date-fns --filter @flightpath/autopilot
```
